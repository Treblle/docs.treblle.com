    - Sensitive fields such as passwords and API keys are **automatically detected and masked**.
    - All data is **encrypted in transit and at rest**.
    - You have full control over what data you log and can **exclude specific fields** in your [SDK configuration](https://docs.treblle.com/integrations/).
    - Treblle offers [compliance scanning](https://docs.treblle.com/features/api-compliance/) to help detect vulnerabilities.
    - Treblle is committed to maintaining high-security standards and is **ISO 27001, GDPR, AICPA SOC 2, CCPA READY, and PCI DSS COMPLIANT**.\n
    Our rigorous assessment process ensures that our infrastructure, sub-processors, third-party vendors, and employees adhere to strict security policies.

        id: 4,
        header: "How can I mask sensitive parts of my endpoints (like dynamic keys in URLs)?",
        text: `Treblle only **masks data** in request/response bodies and headers, **not** the URL path. You have two options if your endpoint URL contains sensitive information (e.g., dynamic keys).\n
        - **Exclude the endpoint entirely:** Use your framework’s middleware or routing controls to bypass Treblle’s logging on that endpoint.
        - **Redesign the URL:** Consider restructuring your endpoint so that sensitive values aren’t part of the path if they don’t need to be visible.

        Check how to [Mask Fields](https://docs.treblle.com/security/masking/) in Treblle.

        header: "How does Treblle generate API docs?",
        text: `Treblle **automatically creates documentation** from the API traffic.\n
        - When your API receives consistent requests to a new endpoint, Treblle analyzes the payloads and generates documentation based on that data.
        - If your documentation isn’t showing up, ensure you're tracking endpoints correctly and keeping request/response payloads in a consistent format.
        - For example, once a new endpoint is created and published, you can use **[Aspen](http://localhost:4321/aspen/)** to make an HTTP call and then see the API Docs on the Treblle Platform.\n
        Check [API documentation](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/api-documentation/) for more information.`

        id: 6,

        - With **Treblle 3.0**, you can rely on **environment variables** instead of hardcoding keys in your integration code.
        - If your \`.env\` file already defines \`TREBLLE_API_KEY\` and \`TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID\`, **remove manual configuration** from your code.
        - This reduces the risk of mismatches between environments. Also, ensure you use the **latest SDK version** supporting Treblle 3.0 changes.`

        You continue using your **custom domain** as usual. Treblle monitors traffic by processing the **data sent by your application**, so **no DNS changes** are necessary.`

        Verify that your **deployment environment** can reach external services and that no **firewall rules or proxy settings** block outbound requests.
        
        Consider adding retries or more detailed logging around your SDK calls to diagnose intermittent delays when establishing SSL connections with Treblle’s servers.`
