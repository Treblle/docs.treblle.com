Treblle is your **API Intelligence Platform** that provides complete visibility, governance, and control across your entire API estate. 

You can't fix what you can't see. Treblle shows you exactly what's happening with your APIs: real requests, actual errors, and performance bottlenecks. Build with confidence instead of guessing.

---

## Understanding Treblle's Architecture

Think of Treblle as an **umbrella platform** that sits across your entire API infrastructure, providing unified visibility and intelligence regardless of where your APIs live or how they're built.

## Integration Paths

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SDK Integration">
    ### Application Level Integration
    
    SDKs integrate directly into your application code, capturing request and response data at the application level.
    
    **Key Benefits:**
    - Deep integration with rich metadata
    - Framework-specific optimizations
    - Easy setup with minimal configuration
    - Rapid deployment for new APIs
    
    **Supported Platforms:**

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="API Gateway Integration">
    ### Infrastructure Level Integration
    
    API Gateway integrations deploy at the infrastructure level, providing automatic discovery and monitoring across all APIs.
    
    **Key Benefits:**
    - Organization-wide visibility from day one
    - Automatic API discovery without code changes
    - Centralized deployment and management
    - Infrastructure-level scalability

## How Treblle Captures API Data

Regardless of your integration method, Treblle follows a consistent data flow:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. Request Interception" icon="magnifier">
    When an API request arrives, Treblle captures request method, URL, headers, body, user information, authentication details, device type, location, network data, and unique identifiers.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2. Data Masking & Security" icon="approve-check">
    Before data leaves your server, Treblle automatically masks sensitive fields, applies custom masking rules, encrypts all data for secure transmission, and ensures compliance with GDPR, SOC 2, and other standards.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="3. Response Capture" icon="document">
    As your API processes requests, Treblle captures response status codes, headers, response body, payload size, processing time, performance metrics, and any errors or exceptions that occurred.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="4. Intelligent Analysis" icon="star">
    Data is analyzed in real-time for performance monitoring, security scanning, compliance checking, and governance scoring against best practices and industry standards.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
