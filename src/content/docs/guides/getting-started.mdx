Treblle helps you build, improve, and observe your APIs with ease. Let's get you set up in just a few minutes.

<Steps>

1. **Create a Treblle Account**
   
   First, [sign up for a free Treblle account](https://identity.treblle.com/register). This will give you access to the Treblle dashboard, where you can observe your APIs.

2. **Create Your First Project**
   
   After logging in:
   - Go to your [Treblle dashboard](https://platform.treblle.com)
   - Click "Create new project"
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Project name
     - Base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
     - Select your platform
     - Choose your environment (Production, Staging, Development, or Local)
     - Optionally add team members' emails

3. **Install the SDK**
   
   Choose the SDK for your platform from our wide range of supported languages and frameworks:

   ### Popular SDKs
   - [Laravel](/integrations/php/laravel/)
   - [Express](/integrations/javascript/express/)
   - [Spring](/integrations/java/spring/)
   - [.NET Core](/integrations/net/net-core/)
   - [Ruby on Rails](/integrations/ruby/rails/)

   Can't find your platform? Check our complete [integrations list](/integrations/) or suggest it on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/qrEyT2pg).

4. **Configure Your API**

   Add your Treblle credentials to your project:
   ```env
   TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_sdk_token
   TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=your_api_id
   ```

5. **Enable Treblle**

   Add the Treblle middleware to your API routes. The exact implementation varies by platform, but here's a general example:

   ```php
   Route::middleware(['treblle'])->group(function () {
       // Your API routes go here
   });
   ```

</Steps>
