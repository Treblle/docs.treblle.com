This quickstart helps you integrate the Treblle SDK into your API and get started with Treblle.

<Steps>

1.  **Create a Treblle Account**

    Go to the Treblle website and [sign up for a free Treblle account](https://treblle.com/).

     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

2.  **Create Your Workspace**

    After logging in, you'll enter your Treblle account settings page. Click on the Treblle Platform button from the Apps section.

     width="800"
     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

    Create a new workspace by clicking on the "Create new workspace" button. You can also join an existing workspace by clicking on the "Join workspace" button.

     width="800"
     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

    Team members can be invited to your workspace at this stage or at a later time.

     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

    The Treblle Homepage provides a bird's-eye view of all your APIs and important metrics related to them. This is also where you can add new APIs.

     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

3.  **Add an API**

    When you're ready to add a new API, enter a logical API name and the base URL of the API.

    :::note
    A base URL includes only the essential parts of the URL (scheme, domain, and optionally, port). Paths, queries, and fragments are excluded.
    Example: https://api.example.com
    :::

    To help with understanding the status of the API, it is also mandatory to add the environment type (Development, Staging, Production) and the framework being used.

    <img
     src="/getting-started/add-new-api.png"
     width="800"
     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

    Based on what language and framework you are using, Treblle will provide you with the necessary SDK to integrate Treblle into your API.

    As suggested by Treblle, follow the next steps and [install the SDK](https://github.com/Treblle?view_as=public#available-sdks).

    Can't find your platform? Check our complete [integrations list](/integrations/).

4.  **Configure Your API**

    Add your Treblle credentials to your project:

    ```
    TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN=your_sdk_token
    ```

5.  **Enable Treblle**

    Add the Treblle middleware to your API routes. The exact implementation varies by platform, but here's a general example:

    ```php
    Route::middleware(['treblle'])->group(function () {
        // Your API routes go here
    });
    ```

</Steps>

## Observing your first API request in Treblle

Once you've added the Treblle API key and SDK token to your API middleware, Treblle will start capturing and monitoring all your API activities.

Once integrated, Treblle automatically provides you with:

- Real-time API monitoring and logging
- Auto-generated [API documentation](/treblle/api-documentation/) with OpenAPI support
- [API governance scoring](/treblle/api-governance/)
- [API security](/treblle/api-security/)
- One-click testing
- API management on the go
- [Error reporting](/treblle/problems/)
