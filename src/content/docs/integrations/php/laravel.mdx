```

:::tip
We've created a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building your Laravel API. Check out our [Laravel API Course](https://apiacademy.treblle.com/laravel-api-course/) for a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough.
:::

## Getting started

Your first step should be to register Treblle into your in your middleware aliases in `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $middlewareAliases = [
  // the rest of your middleware aliases
  'treblle' => \Treblle\Laravel\Middlewares\TreblleMiddleware::class,
];
```

Open the **routes/api.php** and add the Treblle middleware to either a route group like so:

```php
Route::middleware(['treblle'])->group(function () {

  // YOUR API ROUTES GO HERE
  Route::prefix('samples')->group(function () {
    Route::get('{uuid}', [SampleController::class, 'view']);
    Route::post('store', [SampleController::class, 'store']);
  });

});
```

or to an individual route like so:

```php
Route::group(function () {
  Route::prefix('users')->group(function () {

    // IS LOGGED BY TREBLLE
    Route::get('{uuid}', [UserController::class, 'view'])->middleware('treblle');

    // IS NOT LOGGED BY TREBLLE
    Route::post('{uuid}/update', [UserController::class, 'update']);
  });
});
```

You're all set. Next time someone makes a request to your API you will see it in real-time on your Treblle dashboard
alongside other features like: auto-generated documentation, error tracking, analytics and API quality scoring.

## Laravel 11+

If you are using Laravel 11, then all you need to do is register the middleware inside `bootstrap/app.php` like so:

```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
  $middleware->alias([
    'treblle' => \Treblle\Laravel\Middlewares\TreblleMiddleware::class,
  ]);
})
```

Or, alternatively you can inline this inside your routes:

```php
Route::middleware([\Treblle\Laravel\Middlewares\TreblleMiddleware::class])->group(
  // add your observable routes in here.
);
```

## Configuration options

You can configure Treblle using just `.env` variables:

```shell
TREBLLE_IGNORED_ENV=local,dev,test
```

Define which environments Treblle should NOT LOG at all. By default, Treblle will log all environments except local, dev
and test. If you want to change that you can define your own ignored environments by using a comma separated list, or
allow all environments by leaving the value empty.

### Masked fields

Treblle **masks sensitive information** from both the request and response data as well as the request headers data
**before it even leaves your server**. The following parameters are automatically masked: password, pwd, secret,
password_confirmation, cc, card_number, ccv, ssn, credit_score.

You can customize this list by editing your configuration file. If you did not published your configuration file, run
this command first:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=treblle-config
```

This will create a file at `config/treblle.php`. Then, open this file and tweak the masked fields:

```php
return [
    // ...

    /*
     * Define which fields should be masked before leaving the server
     */
    'masked_fields' => [
        'password',
        'pwd',
        'secret',
        'password_confirmation',
        'cc',
        'card_number',
        'ccv',
        'ssn',
        'credit_score',
        'api_key',
    ],
];
```
