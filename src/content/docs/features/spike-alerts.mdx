Spike Alerts are designed to detect sudden and significant increases in API traffic that could indicate DDoS attacks, malfunctioning clients, or unexpected traffic surges. 

This proactive monitoring helps you respond quickly to potential threats and minimize their impact on your infrastructure and costs.

## What Are Spike Alerts?

Spike Alerts monitor your API traffic patterns and notify you when there's an abnormal increase in request volume. Unlike saved search alerts that monitor specific criteria, spike alerts focus on traffic volume patterns and can help detect:

- **DDoS attacks**: Malicious attempts to overwhelm your API
- **Bot traffic**: Automated requests that exceed normal usage patterns
- **Malfunctioning clients**: Applications making excessive requests due to bugs
- **Viral content**: Legitimate but unexpected traffic spikes
- **Retry storms**: Cascading failures causing exponential request growth

## How Spike Detection Works

Treblle's spike detection algorithm analyzes your API traffic using:

- **7-day baseline comparison**: Compares current traffic to your API's 7-day average
- **Time-based analysis**: Evaluates traffic patterns over 15-minute intervals
- **Request volume thresholds**: Detects when traffic exceeds normal variations
- **Pattern recognition**: Distinguishes between organic growth and suspicious spikes

The system automatically adapts to your API's normal traffic patterns, reducing false positives while maintaining sensitivity to genuine threats.

## Setting Up Spike Alerts

### 1. Navigate to My Alerts

- Open the **My Alerts** section from the navigation menu
- Click **New Alert** to create a new alert

### 2. Configure Spike Alert Settings

When creating a new alert, configure the following settings:

#### Alert Type Selection
- **Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "DDoS Protection Alert", "Traffic Spike Monitor")
- **Type**: Select **"Spike"** from the dropdown

#### Fixed Configuration
- **From saved search**: This field is automatically grayed out for Spike alerts
- **Frequency**: Fixed at **15 minutes** for optimal detection sensitivity

#### Notification Settings
- **Channel**: Choose your preferred notification method (Email, Slack, In-app)
- **People**: Select team members who should receive spike alerts

### 3. Notification Channels

#### Email Notifications
Spike alerts via email include:
- Alert timestamp and severity
- Traffic volume comparison (current vs. 7-day average)
- Percentage increase above baseline (e.g., "2720.83% above 7-day average")
- Affected endpoints and request patterns
- Recommended mitigation steps

#### Slack Integration
For Slack notifications:
- Add your [Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in API settings
- Receive real-time alerts with traffic data and quick action links
- Share alerts with your team for coordinated response

#### In-App Notifications
- Immediate dashboard notifications with traffic visualizations
- Historical spike data and trend analysis
- Direct links to affected endpoints and request details
