Aspen is a Treblleâ€™s free, privacy focused, Mac native HTTP client. Built with ZERO trust in mind, there is no login required to run API test. It is specifically made to meet the needs of testing REST APIs, and with the help of AI, instantly help with integrations by generating data models, Open API Specs and generating integration code.


## How does it work?

Simply put in the parameters you want to test and get results in less than a second. Use the AI Companion Alfred to speed up integrations and development.

### Zero Trust Policy

Aspen ensures high data security by not saving any data. All operations are performed locally on your machine, which means there's no risk of your data being stored or handled externally.

### No Login Required

You can start using Aspen immediately without the need for creating an account or logging in. This feature makes it extremely convenient to integrate Aspen into your existing development tools setup.

### Integrated AI Assistant

Aspen comes with an AI assistant that streamlines the API testing process. This assistant helps you quickly run tests, generate integration code, create Open API Specifications, and develop Data Models, all within the same interface. This integration saves time and simplifies the workflow.

### Focus on REST APIs

Aspen is specifically designed for testing REST APIs. This focus means that the tool is optimized for these types of APIs, reducing the time and effort required to set up and conduct tests.
