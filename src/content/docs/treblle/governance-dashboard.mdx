API governance in Treblle ensures your APIs follow industry standards and best practices. 

It evaluates APIs across key areas, such as performance, security, design, and AI Readiness, and helps maintain compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and PCI regulations.

:::note
For Treblle to score your API, please ensure it is exposed to the internet via a public URL. An API running via localhost will not be scored.

## Governance Categories

Treblle’s API governance measures your APIs across four main categories:

  />

### AI Ready

AI Ready ensures your API is structured to allow easier integration with AI systems.

The AI Ready category helps your API adhere to the following specifications:

    - **Parameter Descriptions:** Checks if each parameter has descriptions 
    - **Schema Types or Descriptions:** Checks if each schema has descriptions or types 
    - **Operation ID:** Checks if each operation has an id
    - **Response Descriptions:** Checks if each response has descriptions

  />

### Design

The Design category checks your API's basic structure and usability, ensuring it follows common conventions for clear, easy-to-understand interactions. 

Here’s how Treblle evaluates your API design:
 
    - **Contact Information**: Verifies the presence of contact details (name, email, URL).  
    - **Operation Descriptions or Summaries**: Ensures that all operations have descriptions or summaries. 
    - **Robust Responses**: This check ensures that the API returns more than just the standard `200 OK` response code and provides accurate status codes to reflect different operations' outcomes.
    - **Examples Exist**: Ensures that endpoints include examples for parameters and responses to improve usability.  
    - **Consistent Pluralization**: Ensures that the base endpoint uses plural nouns to represent groups of resources (e.g., `/users` vs `/user`).  
    - **Consistent Noun Usage**: Ensures endpoints are described as nouns instead of verbs. For example, the POST method for endpoint `/user/{id}` vs. `/postUser/{id}`).
    - **JSON Support**: Ensures the content-type header is set to `application/json` for consistent data format.  
    - **Information Descriptions**: Verifies that each endpoint includes a description.
    - **Rate Limiting**: This checks for rate-limiting headers (`rate limit`, `x-rate-limit`) to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage. 
    - **Versioning**: To manage API changes without breaking existing integrations, we recommend URL-based versioning (`/v1`, `/v2`).

### Performance

The Performance category ensures that your APIs are fast, reliable, and optimized for speed.

    - **Load Time**: Ensures responses are returned within an acceptable time frame (preferably under 500ms).  
    - **Compression Support**: This checker determines whether compression `content-encoding` headers exist, speeding up data transmission and reducing packet loss.   
    - **CDN Usage**: Checks for using Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to improve response time and distribution.  
    - **HTTP2 Usage**: This function checks the base URL of the first entry in the servers section for the version of the HTTP server.
    - **Cache Support**: Ensures the `cache-control` header is set to specify browser caching policies, including how resources are cached, where they are cached, and when they expire.

  />

### Security

Security checks ensure your API is protected from common threats and follow industry-standard practices to secure data and access.  

Treblle assesses these critical aspects:

    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Risks**: Ensures path parameters are correctly defined as strings with valid UUIDs, ULIDs, or Mongo ObjectIDs. 
     - **Content Type Options**: The `X-Content-Type-Options` header is set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing attacks.
    - **iFrame Embedding**: Verifies the presence of `X-Frame-Options` to protect against clickjacking attacks.  
    - **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Ensures the `Strict-Transport-Security` header is set to enforce HTTPS usage.    
    - **Content Security Policy**: Ensures `Content-Security-Policy` headers are set to restrict resource loading from unauthorized sources.  
    - **Operation Enforces Security Scheme**: Ensures that security schemes are defined for all operations to prevent unauthorized access.  
    - **Authorization**: Ensures that the API implements proper authorization mechanisms to control access, including the presence of a `securitySchemes` object.
    - **Secure URLs (HTTPs)**: Ensures requests require HTTPS for encrypted communication.  
    - **Security Field Contains a Scheme**: Ensures the security field is not empty and includes proper definitions.
    - **Global Security Field is Defined**: This checks whether the global security field is defined for the API.

  />

After evaluating these categories, Treblle assigns an API score out of 100, along with a grade ranging from **A** to **F**, to help you track the quality of your API governance.
