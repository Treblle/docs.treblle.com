Treblle's Sustainability features help you monitor and understand the environmental impact of your APIs by tracking CO2 emissions generated by API usage. 

This enables organizations to make informed decisions about their digital carbon footprint and work towards more sustainable API practices.

### Benefits of CO2 Emissions Tracking

- **Identify carbon hotspots** in your API infrastructure
- **Align API architecture** with green engineering goals
- **Quantify emissions reduction** from optimization efforts
- **Support sustainability reporting** and compliance requirements
- **Make data-driven decisions** about API efficiency and environmental impact

## How CO2 Emissions Are Calculated

Treblle uses a comprehensive estimation formula for every API request:

### Calculation Formula

```
API CO₂ = N × ((T × P) + (S × D)) × E
```

**Where:**
- **N** = Number of API requests
- **T** = Average API load time (in seconds)
- **S** = Average response size (in MB)
- **P** = Estimated compute energy usage per second (kWh/s)
- **D** = Estimated data transfer energy usage per MB (kWh/MB)
- **E** = AWS regional carbon intensity (kg CO₂ / kWh)

### Calculation Components

#### 1. Compute Load
API requests consume energy based on execution time. The formula `T × P` estimates the energy used for processing each request.

#### 2. Data Transfer
API responses use network energy that scales with response size. The formula `S × D` estimates the energy required for data transmission.

#### 3. Total Energy
The sum of compute and transfer energy per request, scaled by the total number of requests (N).

#### 4. CO₂ Conversion
Total energy consumption is converted to CO₂ emissions using regional electricity carbon intensity factors.

### Assumptions & Estimates

The calculation uses industry-standard estimates:

- **P (Power per second)**: Varies by cloud provider (~0.0001–0.0005 kWh/s)
- **D (Power per MB)**: ~0.00001–0.00002 kWh/MB for data centers
- **E (CO₂ per kWh)**: Varies by region (~0.4 kg CO₂/kWh for average electricity mix)

## Viewing CO2 Emissions

CO2 emissions data can be viewed at two levels in Treblle:

### 1. Workspace Level - Combined Emissions

Track CO2 emissions across all APIs in your workspace for organization-wide sustainability monitoring.

#### Enabling Workspace CO2 Tracking

1. **Navigate to Workspace Dashboard**
   
   Go to your main workspace dashboard (Home page).

2. **Customize Dashboard**
   
   Click the **Customize Dashboard** button (four squares icon) on the right side of the dashboard.

3. **Enable CO2 Emissions Widget**
   
   In the customize menu, find and enable the **"CO2 Emissions"** widget.

   />

4. **Save Changes**
   
   Click **Save Changes** to add the CO2 emissions widget to your workspace dashboard.

#### Workspace CO2 Widget Features

The workspace-level CO2 widget displays:
- **Total CO2 emissions** across all APIs in kilograms
- **Time-based trends** showing emission patterns
- **Percentage change** compared to previous periods
- **Environmental impact overview** for the entire API portfolio

### 2. API Level - Individual API Emissions

Monitor CO2 emissions for specific APIs to identify which services have the highest environmental impact.

#### Enabling API-Level CO2 Tracking

1. **Navigate to Individual API Dashboard**
   
   Select the specific API you want to monitor from your workspace.

2. **Customize API Dashboard**
   
   Click the **Customize Dashboard** button (four squares icon) on the API dashboard.

3. **Enable CO2 Emissions Widget**
   
   In the customize menu, find and enable the **"CO2 Emissions"** widget for the individual API.

   <img

     width="800"
     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
   />

4. **Save Configuration**
   
   Click **Save Changes** to add the CO2 emissions tracking to your API dashboard.

#### API-Level CO2 Widget Features

The API-level CO2 widget shows:
- **CO2 emissions** specific to the individual API
- **Emission trends** over time for that API
- **Performance correlation** between load times and emissions
- **Optimization opportunities** for reducing carbon footprint
