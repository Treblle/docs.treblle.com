The Customer Dashboard in Treblle provides a comprehensive view of your API's usage by individual customers. 

It helps you understand how different customers interact with your API, identify trends in their usage patterns, and pinpoint potential issues or areas for improvement.

## Accessing the Customer Dashboard

The Customer Dashboard is available at the **individual API level**. To access it:

1. Navigate to the specific API you want to analyze.
2. Click on **"Customers"** in the left navigation bar.

  />

3. The Customer Dashboard will display all customers and their usage data for that specific API.

:::tip
At the workspace level (Home page), you can view a **Top Customers widget** showing high-level customer metrics across all APIs. For detailed customer analysis, use the Customer Dashboard at the individual API level.

## Customer Dashboard Overview

The Customer Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all customers using your API. 

Here's what you'll find:
    
  - **Customer Profiles:**  A list of all your customers, identified by their display name or Customer ID. When available, Treblle shows the customer's display name for easier identification instead of technical IDs.
  - **Request Count:**  The total number of API requests each customer makes.
  - **Overall Percentage:** The percentage of total API requests attributed to each customer, giving you a sense of their impact on your API traffic.
  - **Last Active:** A timestamp indicating when each customer made their last API request.

    />

### Dashboard Customization

You can customize the Customer Dashboard to show the widgets that matter most to you:

1. Click the **Customize Dashboard** button (grid icon) in the top-right corner.
2. Enable or disable widgets such as:
   - **New Customers**: Number of new customers in your API
   - **Active Customers**: Number of active customers in your API
   - **Top Customer**: Customer with highest number of requests
   - **Average Requests Per Customer**: Average number of API requests made by all customers
   - **Customers List**: List of 10 most recent customers in your API
   - **Favorite Customers**: List of customers you marked as favorite
   - **Top Customers List**: List of customers with highest number of requests in your API

    />

## Individual Customer Profile

Click on any customer from the list to access their detailed profile and request history.

### Customer Profile Overview

The Individual Customer Profile provides:

  - **Customer Name:**  The display name or customer ID at the top of the page
  - **Total Requests:**  The total number of API requests made by this customer
  - **Overall Percentage:**  The percentage of total API requests attributed to this customer
  - **Request Graph:**  A visual representation of the customer's API request activity over time, helping you identify peak usage periods, trends, and potential anomalies
  - **Description Field:**  Space to add notes or context about the customer

    <img
      src="/platform/customers/individual-customer.jpg"
      width="800"
      style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

### Customer Request History

Below the overview, you'll find a complete list of all API requests made by that customer, including:

  - **Method:**  HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.)
  - **Response:**  Response status code
  - **Name:**  Endpoint name or path
  - **Load Time:**  Request processing duration
  - **Threat Level:**  Security assessment (Low, Medium, High)
  - **Device:**  Device type used for the request
  - **AI Agent:**  AI service detection if applicable
  - **Location:**  Geographic location of the request
  - **Time:**  Timestamp of the request

You can filter, search, and sort these requests to analyze specific patterns or troubleshoot issues for individual customers.

## Adding Customer/User Information to Requests

`treblle-user-id` is used to identify your customers. You can pass any value here, such as ID, UUID, email, username, or company name.

The header can be included in either Request or Response Headers - Treblle will pick them up from both.

:::note
When you provide a display name or customer identifier, Treblle will show this name in the Customer Dashboard instead of just the technical customer ID, making it easier to identify and analyze customer behavior.

### Steps to add the Customer Information in Treblle's [Express SDK](https://docs.treblle.com/integrations/javascript/express/)

Here's how you can modify your [Express](https://docs.treblle.com/integrations/javascript/express/) middleware to add these headers:

```javascript
// Custom middleware to add Customer information
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user) {  // Ensure the user is authenticated
        req.headers['treblle-user-id'] = req.user.id; // Attach Customer ID
    }
    next();
});

// Treblle Middleware
app.use(treblle({
    apiKey: process.env.TREBLLE_API_KEY,
    projectId: process.env.TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID
}));
```

### Treblle Dashboard View of Customer Information

The image below shows how the customer information will appear on the Treblle dashboard once you add it to the request.

### Implementing Customer ID Tracking in Other SDKs

For other SDKs, the approach is similar. Here's how you can implement it:

1. First, check the user authentication, and then you can retrieve the Customer ID from the authentication system.

   ```bash
   if (isAuthenticated) {
       customerId = getCustomerIdFromSession() // Fetch Customer ID from session or token
   }
   ```

2. After authentication, you can add the Customer ID to the request headers (typically as "treblle-user-id").

   ```bash
   request.headers.set('treblle-user-id', customerId)
   ```

3. Apply middleware to track customer data in API requests.

   ```bash
   applyMiddleware('customerTrackingMiddleware', routes) 
   ```

For specific integration details for other SDKs, please refer to the [Integration page](https://docs.treblle.com/integrations/).
