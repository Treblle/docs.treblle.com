Treblle's AI Agent Detection feature automatically identifies when API requests originate from AI services like Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other large language models (LLMs). 

This helps you understand how AI agents interact with your APIs, monitor AI-driven traffic patterns, and optimize your API for AI consumption.

## What is AI Agent Detection?

AI Agent Detection analyzes incoming API requests to identify when they originate from AI services rather than traditional applications or human users. 

Treblle recognizes various AI agents including:

- **Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant)
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI's conversational AI)
- **Perplexity** (AI-powered search and answer engine)
- Other AI services and LLMs

This detection happens automatically for every request, with no additional configuration required.

## Enabling AI Agent Column

To view AI agent detection in your requests:

1. **Navigate to Requests**
   
   Go to the **Requests** section in your API dashboard.

2. **Open View Fields**
   
   Click the **View fields** button in the top-right corner of the Requests table.

3. **Enable AI Agent Column**
   
   In the column visibility menu, toggle **AI Agent** to enable it.

## Viewing AI Agent Information

### AI Agent Column in Requests Table

Once enabled, the **AI Agent** column displays which AI service made each request.

The AI Agent column shows:
- **Specific AI agent name** (e.g., "Claude", "ChatGPT", "Perplexity") when detected
- **Dash (-)** when the request originates from a non-AI source

For detailed information about AI agent usage in a specific request:

1. **Select a Request**
   
   Click on any request from the Requests list to open the detailed view.

2. **Navigate to Info Tab**
   
   Click on the **Info** tab in the request details panel.

3. **View AI Agent Information**
   
   In the **User Data** section, you'll see the **AI Agent** field displaying the detected AI service.
