## Treblle Roles and Permissions

Treblle provides **two layers of roles and permissions**:
- **Workspace Level:** Manage who can access, administer, and add APIs across your entire workspace.
- **API Level:** Manage who can access and modify individual APIs with granular control.

This ensures **security, accountability, and efficient collaboration** across your API landscape.


## Workspace-Level Roles and Permissions
### Key Actions
Under **Workspace Settings > People**, workspace **Owners** can:
- **Invite users** via email or an **invite link** (link expires in 24 hours and can be regenerated anytime).
- **Assign roles** (Owner, Member, Customer) during or after inviting.
- **View and manage users**, including their emails and roles.
- **Change user roles** as team needs evolve.
- **Delete users** to remove workspace access.
