Endpoints in Treblle represent the URIs that expose specific parts of your API. 

Once you integrate your API with Treblle, it automatically identifies and organizes these endpoints in the **Endpoints** tab.

## Steps to View Endpoints:

1. Click on **Endpoints** in the left navigation bar.

    />

2. The endpoint dashboard will display all the available endpoints.

    />

## Check Endpoints

For each endpoint, you can view:

- **HTTP Method**: The type of request, e.g., GET, POST.
- **Last Request**: Timestamp of the most recent request.
- **Total Requests**: Total number of requests received.
- **Description**: Brief details about the endpoint.
- **Average Load Time**: The endpoint's average response time.
- **Requests Graph**: A daily visualization of requests made to the endpoint.

### Viewing Requests

To view requests made to a specific endpoint, You can:

- **Filter** requests using the **Filter** option ( Requests, User Information, Security & Compliance, Metadata ).
- **Sort** requests using the **SORT BY** option ( Created at, Path, Threat level, Load time ).
- Toggle between table or list views for convenience.

Each endpoint has additional options accessible from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner:

#### Add or Remove an Endpoint from API Docs

 - **Add to Docs**: Select **INCLUDE IN DOCS** from the dropdown menu. This makes the endpoint and its details visible in the project's auto-generated API documentation.

 - **Remove from Docs**: Select **REMOVE FROM DOCS** to hide the endpoint from the API documentation.

#### Mute or Unmute an Endpoint

 - **Mute**: Requests to the endpoint will no longer appear in your project, and alerts for that endpoint will stop. Click Mute in the dropdown menu to enable this.

 - **Unmute**: To re-enable the visibility of requests and alerts for a muted endpoint, click Unmute in the dropdown menu.

#### Add an Alias to an Endpoint

 - Click on **EDIT** to assign the endpoint an alias (an alternative name) to make it easier to find during filtering.

 - Example:
     For the endpoint `articles/{articleUuid}/favorite`:
       - **Alias Name**: Article Favoriting
       - **Short Description**: Marks an article as a favorite for the user.

     />


#### Delete an Endpoint

 - Remove the endpoint from the project by selecting **Delete** in the dropdown menu. 

 - Deleting an endpoint also removes it from the API documentation and disassociates all related requests.


Treblle automatically organizes endpoints into groups based on their paths. 
For example, `/users/:id` and `/users/verify` are grouped under the **users** group to facilitate filtering and management.
