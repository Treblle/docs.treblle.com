  description: Understand and manage errors captured by the Treblle SDK within the Problems tab of a project.

Treblle identifies both codebase and non-codebase errors captured by the Treblle SDK. For instance, it can detect misspellings that might affect your API documentation. 


## Steps to view the Problems Tab

1. Click on **Problems** in the left navigation bar.

    <img
      src="/platform/problems/problems.png"
      width="200"
      style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

2. The Problem dashboard will display all the problems.

    <img
      src="/platform/problems/overview.png"
      width="800"
      style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

The Problems tab provides the following details for each issue:

    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

- **HTTP Method:** Associated with the problem (if applicable).
- **Severity Level:** Categorized as Low, Medium, or High.
- **Occurrences:** Number of times this problem has occurred in the project.
- **Total Problems Count:** Number of problems across all endpoints.
- **Error Description:** Description of the problem.
- **Graph:** Displays "Requests with Problems" for a selected period.

    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

Treblle performs 15 security checks on every API request and assigns them under **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** threat levels.

## Viewing Problems in Requests

To inspect specific requests with problems, you can:

- **Filter** requests using the **Filter** option ( Requests, User Information, Security & Compliance, Metadata ).
- **Sort** requests using the **SORT BY** option ( Created at, Path, Threat level, Load time ).
- Toggle between table or list views for convenience.
