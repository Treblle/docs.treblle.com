Treblle identifies both codebase and non-codebase errors captured by the Treblle SDK. For instance, it can detect misspellings that might affect your API documentation.

The Problems tab provides the following details for each issue:

  />

- **HTTP Method:** Associated with the problem (if applicable).
- **Severity Level:** Categorized as Low, Medium, or High.
- **Occurrences:** Number of times this problem has occurred in the project.
- **Total Problems Count:** Number of problems across all endpoints.

  />

Treblle performs 15 security checks on every API request and assigns them under **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** threat levels.

## Viewing Problems in Requests

To inspect specific requests with problems, you can:

- **Filter** requests using the **Filter** option ( Requests, User Information, Security & Compliance, Metadata ).
- **Sort** requests using the **SORT BY** option ( Created at, Path, Threat level, Load time ).
- Toggle between table or list views for convenience.
