## What is API Insights?

[API Insights](https://apiinsights.io/),

## Step to Setup API Insights

You can use API Insights in several ways, depending on your preference. You can access it via:

1. **[Web Browser](https://apiinsights.io/)**
2. **[VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=treblle.apiinsights-vscode)**
3. **[CLI Tool](https://github.com/Treblle/treblle-cli)**
4. **Using the [MacOS app](https://apps.apple.com/hr/app/api-insights-by-treblle/id6468354004)**

### Option 1: **Web Browser (Dashboard)**

API Insights can be accessed through [apiinsights.io/](https://apiinsights.io/).

#### Example: **Demo V1.0.0 API Results**

This report is based on [Demo API](https://apiinsights.io/reports/demo-report) data.

/>

The dashboard is organized into different categories to help you quickly analyze key metrics:

1. **Design Insights**
2. **Performance Insights**
3. **Security Insights**

#### How Do We Calculate This?

Treblle’s API Insights uses industry-standard methods to calculate and categorize these metrics. For example:

- **Design Issues** are identified based on predefined API design best practices.
- **Performance metrics** are calculated based on each request's response times and server performance.
- **Security checks** are based on common security vulnerabilities and attack patterns, such as IDOR and missing security headers.

## Option 2: **VS Code Extension**

The API Insights VS Code Extension allows you to observe your API performance directly from your development environment.

This extension integrates with your codebase and lets you view critical API metrics without switching contexts.

#### Installation

To install the API Insights VS Code Extension:

1. Open **VS Code** and go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2. Search for **Treblle API Insights**.
3. Click **Install**.

### Getting Started

2. **Select a File from Your Workspace**

   - You can begin the process once you have your **OpenAPI spec** file (usually in JSON or YAML format) in your workspace.
   - Open the file in VS Code.
   - The extension will automatically check the file and provide insights based on the API's design, performance, and security.

   **Note**: The extension works with OpenAPI specifications, so ensure your file is correctly formatted.

   />

### Re-check the Score on File Changes

- The extension tracks any changes made to the file. If you modify the OpenAPI spec file, it will automatically re-check and update the score.
- Whenever a file change is detected, a prompt will appear in your editor, reminding you to re-check the score.

  />

## Option 3: **CLI Tool**

You can use the API Insights CLI tool if you prefer working in the terminal.

The CLI helps automate these checks, enabling teams to enforce quality without manual intervention.

- **To use API Insights GitHub action with your project. Please visit** [**marketplace**](https://github.com/treblle/treblle-cli).

### Installing Treblle CLI

You can install the Treblle CLI using `Homebrew` on Mac or Linux:

```bash
brew tap treblle/treblle
brew install treblle
```

#### Using API Insights with CLI

- Once installed, use the insights command to generate a report for your API by uploading your OpenAPI specification:

```bash
treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json
```

By default, this will give you an overview of your API’s performance, design, and security scores. You can also pass additional flags for detailed analysis.

#### Available Options

1. Technology Profile

- To see the technology profile discovered on your API, use the `--technology` flag:

  ```bash
  treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --technology
  ```

2. Details

- For a deep dive into specific categories, use the `--details` flag with one of the following options:

  ```bash
   --details=performance to show performance test results.
   --details=security to display security test results.
   --details=quality for quality checks.
   --details=all to show all categories.
  ```

**Example:**

```bash
 treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --details=all
```

3. Minimum Score Limit

- Set a minimum score threshold for automated testing in CI/CD environments using the `--minimum` flag. For example, to require a minimum score of `90`:

  ```bash
   treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --minimum 90
  ```

## Option 4: **Using the MacOS App**

The app provides a user-friendly way to view your API insights directly from your Mac.

Visit the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hr/app/api-insights-by-treblle/id6468354004) and download the macOS app.

This works like the browser version, allowing you to manage and monitor your APIs with the same insights and features in a more convenient desktop interface.

## AI-Ready API Feature

As part of Treblle's commitment to making API integration with AI and LLMs smoother, we’ve introduced the AI-Ready badge.

This badge is awarded when your API meets key criteria for AI integration.

#### What Makes an API AI-Ready?

  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

The AI-Ready badge is granted when your API adheres to the following specifications:

- **Endpoints Descriptions:** Each endpoint has a detailed and user-friendly description.
- **Operation IDs:** Each endpoint must have a distinct OperationID.
- **Parameters Descriptions:** Every parameter should clearly describe usage, expected data type, and input format.
- **Response Descriptions:** All responses must have HTTP status codes and descriptions.
- **Schemas:** A schema must have a defined type and description if a schema exists.

These checks ensure that your API is designed so that AI/LLMs can easily interact with, enabling smoother integration and better user experiences.

This new feature is integrated directly into API Insights, so when you meet these requirements, your API will automatically receive an AI-Ready badge.
