### What is API Insights?

[API Insights](https://apiinsights.io/) is an advanced API governance tool that evaluates your APIs against industry best practices.

You just need to upload your [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) (JSON or YAML) to get a score (1-100) and grade (A-F) in design, security, and performance.

### Step to Setup API Insights

You can use API Insights in several ways, depending on your preference. You can access it via:

1. **[Web Browser](https://apiinsights.io/)**
2. **[VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=treblle.apiinsights-vscode)**
3. **[CLI Tool](https://github.com/Treblle/treblle-cli)**
4. **Using the [MacOS app](https://apps.apple.com/hr/app/api-insights-by-treblle/id6468354004)**

### Option 1: **Web Browser (Dashboard)**

API Insights can be accessed through [apiinsights.io/](https://apiinsights.io/).

#### Example: **Analysing a demo API**

This report is based on the [Demo API](https://apiinsights.io/reports/demo-report) which has 33 endpoints.

/>

The dashboard is organized into different categories to help you quickly analyze key metrics:

1. **Design Insights**
2. **Performance Insights**
3. **Security Insights**

#### How Do We Calculate This?

We combine your OpenAPI Spec and the data we get from a single request to your server. We run a series of checks and compare them to industry standards and best practices.

For example:

- **Design Issues** are identified based on predefined API design best practices.
- **Performance metrics** are calculated based on each request's response times and server performance.
- **Security checks** are based on common security vulnerabilities and attack patterns, such as IDOR and missing security headers.

### Option 2: VS Code Extension

The API Insights VS Code Extension allows you to observe your API performance directly from your development environment.

#### Installation

To install the API Insights VS Code Extension:

    1. Open **VS Code** and go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
    2. Search for **Treblle API Insights**.
    3. Click **Install**.

/>

#### Getting Started

Select a File from Your Workspace

    1. You can begin the process once you have your **OpenAPI spec** file (usually in JSON or YAML format) in your workspace.
    2. Open the file in VS Code.
    3. The extension will automatically check the file and provide insights based on the API's design, performance, and security.

:::note
The extension works with OpenAPI specifications, so ensure your file is correctly formatted.

#### Re-check the Score on File Changes

The extension tracks any changes made to the file. If you modify the OpenAPI spec file, it will automatically re-check and update the score.

Whenever a file change is detected, a prompt will appear in your editor, reminding you to re-check the score.

### Option 3: CLI Tool

You can use the API Insights CLI tool if you prefer working in the terminal.

:::note
To use API Insights GitHub action with your project. Please visit [marketplace](https://github.com/treblle/treblle-cli).
:::

#### Installing Treblle CLI

You can install the Treblle CLI using `Homebrew` on Mac or Linux:

```bash
brew tap treblle/treblle
brew install treblle
```

#### Using API Insights with CLI

     Once installed, use the insights command to generate a report for your API by uploading your OpenAPI specification:

     ```bash
     treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json
     ```

     By default, this will give you an overview of your API’s performance, design, and security scores. You can also pass additional flags for detailed analysis.

#### Available Options

    1. Technology Profile: To see the technology profile discovered on your API, use the `--technology` flag:

        ```bash
        treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --Technology
        ```

    2. Details: For a deep dive into specific categories, use the `--details` flag with one of the following options:

        ```bash
        --details=performance to show performance test results.
        --details=security to display security test results.
        --details=quality for quality checks.
         ```

         **Example:**

         ```bash
         treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --details=All
         ```

3. Minimum Score Limit

- Set a minimum score threshold for automated testing in CI/CD environments using the `--minimum` flag. For example, to require a minimum score of `90`:

  ```bash
   treblle-cli insights path/to/openapi-spec.json --minimum 90
  ```

### Option 4: **Using the MacOS App**

Visit the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hr/app/api-insights-by-treblle/id6468354004) and download the macOS app.

The app works like the browser version with the same insights and features in a more convenient desktop interface.

### AI Readiness for your API

As part of Treblle's commitment to making API integration with AI and LLMs smoother, we’ve introduced the AI-Ready badge.

This badge is awarded when your API meets key criteria for AI integration.

#### What Makes an API AI-Ready?

The AI-Ready badge is granted when your API adheres to the following specifications:

1. **Endpoints Descriptions:** Each endpoint has a detailed and user-friendly description.

   Example: GET `/users`

   Description: Fetches a list of all users in the system. Useful for retrieving user information for management or reporting

2. **Operation IDs:** Each endpoint must have a distinct OperationID.

   Example: `createUser`, `deleteOrder`, or `getOrderDetails`.

3. **Parameters Descriptions:** Every parameter should clearly describe usage, expected data type, and input format.

   Example: Query Parameters for `GET /users`.

   - `page` _(integer)_: Page number for paginated results. Default: `1`.
   - `limit` _(integer)_: Number of users per page. Default: `10`.

   Path Parameters for `GET /users/{id}`.

   - `id` _(string)_: Unique identifier of the user.

4. **Response Descriptions:** All responses must have HTTP status codes and descriptions.

   Example Responses for GET /users:

   - 200 OK: Successfully retrieved the list of users.
   - 400 Bad Request: Invalid query parameter(s) provided.
   - 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error occurred.

   Example 200 Response:

   ```bash
   {
    {
       "users": [
        { "id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
        { "id": "124", "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com" }
        ]
        }
   ```

5. **Schemas:** A schema must have a defined type and description if a schema exists.

   Example:

   ```bash
   {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier for the user" },
      "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Full name of the user" },
      "email": { "type": "string", "description": "Email address of the user" }
      }
      }
   ```

So when you meet these requirements, your API will automatically receive an AI-Ready badge.
