The API Dashboard in Treblle gives you a 360-degree, bird’s-eye view of all your APIs in one place, helping you track, manage, and improve your API estate with clarity and speed. It goes a level deeper than the Home page, providing detailed insights so everyone, from someone like a CIO or a CTO to a developer or even a non-technical person, can clearly understand the API landscape.
With the API Dashboard, you can enable quick, confident decision-making while saving hours of engineering time and resources by spotting issues faster, prioritizing improvements, and tracking adoption and governance across your APIs without manual digging.

## Actions You Can Take From This Page
Here’s what you can do while using the API Dashboard:
- **Switch between workspaces easily**: Use the top-left corner dropdown to move between different workspaces without losing context.
- **Create a new API**: Add a new API to your workspace using the **New API** button on the left navigation bar or beside the time range buttons.
- **Use the time filter**: Toggle between the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, all time, or a custom range to analyze API trends over the timeframe you care about.
- **Sort, filter, and favorite APIs**: Quickly organize your API list to focus on what matters most for your team by using sorting, filtering, and favoriting options.
- **Access workspace-level functionality**: Navigate to **API Tracing, API Catalog, or Settings** (if you are a Treblle admin) directly from the left navigation bar for workspace management.


## Key Highlights
- **Individual API Blocks**: Each API in your workspace is displayed as a **dedicated, clear block** showing essential details at a glance, making it easy to scan and prioritize across all your APIs.
- **Requests and Endpoints**: See **total requests** and **endpoints** per API directly on the dashboard, on every API block. This helps you:
  - Track adoption and usage
  - Identify your most active APIs
  - Manage and plan for growth trends
- **Heartbeat with Good(Green) and Bad(Red) Requests**: Each API block includes a **compact heartbeat graph** showing request trends with:
  - **Green** indicating successful requests
  - **Red** indicating errors  

  This makes it easy to spot spikes, drops, and anomalies in API performance at a glance.
- **API Governance Score for Every API**: View the **governance and compliance score** for each API, allowing you to:
  - Track adherence to security and governance standards
  - Identify APIs that need improvement
  - Maintain a consistent quality baseline across your API estate
