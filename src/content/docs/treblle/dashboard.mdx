The Individual API Dashboard in Treblle is your command center for managing and understanding a single API, giving you clear visibility into real-time visibility, performance, security, documentation, governance, and a lot more in one place. It not only helps engineering, product, and platform teams but also support, business, and some of the non-technical teams understand how each API is used, who are the customers of a particular API, and what needs improvement.

## Individual API Dashboard Overview
The individual API dashboard is a single access point to your API data. It offers a collection of visualizations that you can configure based on your API needs. 
- APIs are no more managed in silos, making it easy to understand real usage and issues at the individual API level.
- This dashboard helps you move from guesswork to informed action with real-time insights, governance scoring, and request-level details.
- It enables faster debugging, better product planning, and stronger API security, compliance, and governance.

For example, if you notice a sudden spike in response times, you can quickly compare it with the previous period to determine if this is a new issue or a recurring pattern. This becomes particularly valuable when:
- Debugging performance issues reported by customers
- Planning infrastructure scaling based on usage patterns
- Preparing reports for stakeholders
- Monitoring the impact of recent API changes

Choose from three time windows to view your API data:
- **Last 24 hours**: Perfect for spotting immediate issues and monitoring day-to-day operations
- **Last 7 days**: Ideal for identifying weekly patterns and recent trends
- **Last 30 days**: Great for monthly reporting and long-term trend analysis
- **All Time**: Useful for reviewing the complete API history and long-term baselines.
- **Custom**: Allows focused analysis on specific incidents, campaigns, or timeframes relevant to your business.

Toggle the **Compare** option on any graph to see how your current metrics stack up against previous periods. It’s a quick way to track progress, spot improvements, or catch issues before they grow.
