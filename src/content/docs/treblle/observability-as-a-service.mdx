Treblle’s embedded observability allows you to integrate real-time API request visibility into your developer portal directly. 

Developers can inspect requests, filter logs, and troubleshoot integration issues without a separate observability stack.

## Steps to Embedd Treblle's Observability 

##### Adding the Observability Script

Include the Treblle observability script in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://assets.treblle.com/oaas-v8.min.js"></script>
```

##### Embedding Treblle's Observability Logs

Identify where you want to display API request logs and add the following `<div>`:

For dark theme:

```html
<div class="treblle-embeded-logs dark-theme" data-project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" data-customer="YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID">
```

For default theme:

```html
<div class="treblle-embedded-logs" data-projects="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" data-customers="YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID"></div>
```

Replace:

`YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your Treblle API ID (found under API Settings).

    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

`YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID` with the customer name (found under Customer Section).

  <img
    src="/platform/observability-as-a-service/customer.png"
    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />


##### Save and Refresh

After adding the script and `<div>`, save your changes and reload the portal. You should now see a real-time API request log section.

### DEMO API Example

This Demo API is an experience example. You can copy and test it in your environment to see how it works. Since it's a demo example, you can use the same project and customer ID.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no" />
    <meta name="description" content="Observability As A Service - Treblle" />
    <meta name="author" content="Treblle" />
    <title>Observability As A Service - Treblle</title>
</head>

<body style="background-color: #181821; /*background-color: #181821;*/">
    <div style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 1140px; width: 100%">
        <div class="treblle-embeded-logs dark-theme" data-project="ByGdzSo2L0OI2OKu" data-customer="vedran">
        </div>
    </div>

    <script src="https://assets.treblle.com/oaas-v8.min.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

After following the steps above, you should see embedded observability in your developer portal:

    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

## Filtering API Requests

- Timeframe – View API requests within a specific date and time range.
- Threat Level – Identify and filter requests based on security risk levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Response Code – Sort requests by HTTP status codes like 200, 400, or 500.
- HTTP Method – Filter requests by method type, such as GET, POST, or DELETE.
- Device – See API requests grouped by device type (mobile, desktop, IOS, etc.).
- Endpoint – Focus on requests to a specific API route or path.
- User Location – Track and filter requests based on the user's location.
- Request Data – Inspect request payloads, headers, and query parameters.
