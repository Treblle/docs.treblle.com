### What is Alfred AI?

[Alfred](https://treblle.com/product/alfred) is Treblle’s AI assistant. It helps improve your API workflows by using your API documentation to provide real-time answers.

:::note
Alfred accesses only your API documentation and does not store or analyze your data. Based on your current API setup it helps you improve your documentation and integration process.
:::

There are several ways to use Alfred:

- Integrating with Treblle SDK.
- Uploading your OpenAPI Specification.
- Embedding Alfred to your Developer Portal.

### Integrating with Treblle SDK

Integrating the Treblle SDK will automatically generate API docs and a developer portal with Alfred.

You can find integration guides for various languages and platforms [here](https://www.treblle.com/integrations/).

#### Step 1: Accessing Alfred

  Go to the API Docs section of your Treblle workspace.

   <img
    src="/platform/alfred/api-docs.png"
    width="200"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
   />

  Look for Alfred in the bottom right corner of the screen.

   <img
     src="/platform/alfred/alfred.png"
     width="800"
     style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
   />

#### Step 2: Interact with Alfred

  Click on Alfred to open an interface with predefined prompts.

  <img

    width="300"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

  Ask questions or request assistance with your API documentation, such as identifying issues, generating code examples, or improving endpoint documentation.

#### Example:

<img
  src="/platform/alfred/example.png"
  width="300"
  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

### Uploading your OpenAPI Specification

If you are not integrating the Treblle SDK, you can upload your [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (version 3 or above) directly to the Treblle platform.

:::note
To keep Alfred's information up to date, you must manually update the specification whenever changes occur.
:::

#### Step 1: Access OpenAPI Specification

  Go to the API Setting section of your Treblle workspace.

  <img
    src="/platform/alfred/api-setting.png"
    width="200"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

#### Step 2: Upload OpenAPI Specification

  Click on upload to add your OpenAPI Specification.

  <img
    src="/platform/alfred/open-api.png"
    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

### Embedding Alfred to your Developer Portal

To embed Alfred into your developer portal, follow these steps:

1. Add a one-line script to your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://assets.treblle.com/alfred@1.0.3.js"></script>
   ```

   Place the script before your portal's `</body>` tag to ensure smooth page rendering.

2. Replace `_YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_` with your API ID and `_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_` with your SDK TOKEN.

   ```javascript
   <div
     class="getalfred-io"
     data-api="_YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_"
     data-auth="_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_"
   ></div>
   ```
