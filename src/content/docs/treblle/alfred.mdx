## What is Alfred AI?

[Alfred](https://treblle.com/product/alfred) is Treblleâ€™s AI assistant that helps improve your API workflows. It uses your API documentation to provide real-time answers.

:::note
Alfred accesses only your API documentation and does not store or analyze your data. It helps you by improving your documentation and integration process based on your current API setup.
:::

You can use Alfred in several ways:

### Integrate with Treblle SDK

Integrating the Treblle SDK will automatically generate API docs and a developer portal with Alfred.

You can find integration guides for various languages and platforms [here](https://www.treblle.com/integrations/).

#### Step 1: Access Alfred

- Go to the API Docs section of your Treblle workspace.

  <img

    width="200"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

- Look for Alfred in the bottom right corner of the screen.

  <img

    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

#### Step 2: Interact with Alfred

- Click on Alfred to open an interface with predefined prompts.

    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

- Ask questions or request assistance with your API documentation, such as identifying issues, generating code examples, or improving endpoint documentation.

#### Example:

<img
  src="/platform/alfred/example.png"
  width="300"
  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

### Upload your OpenAPI Specification

If you are not integrating the Treblle SDK, you can upload your [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (version 3 or above) directly to the Treblle platform.

:::note
You will need to update the specification manually whenever changes are made to keep Alfred's information up to date.
:::

#### Step 1: Access OpenAPI Specification

- Go to the API Setting section of your Treblle workspace.

  <img
    src="/platform/alfred/api-setting.png"
    width="200"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

#### Step 2: Upload OpenAPI Specification

- Click on upload to add your OpenAPI Specification.

    width="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

### Embed Alfred in your Developer Portal

To embed Alfred into your developer portal, follow these steps:

1. Add a one line script to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://assets.treblle.com/alfred-embed-v5.min.js"></script>
```

Place the script before your portal's `</body>` tag to ensure smooth page rendering.

2. Replace `_YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_` with your API ID and `_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_` with your SDK TOKEN. This enables Alfred to append your customer's details into the integration process.

 ```javascript
<div
  class="getalfred-io"
  data-api="_YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_"
  data-auth="_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_"
></div>
```
