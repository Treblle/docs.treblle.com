Treblle performs 13 automated security checks on every API request and assigns a **Threat Level** based on detected vulnerabilities. 

The system analyzes each request into three threat levels: Low, Medium, or High. By default, it marks requests without detected threats as Low Threat Level.

## Steps to view API Security

1. You can go to the **Request** tab in the left navigation bar.

      width="200"
      style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />

2. You can select a specific request or use filters to narrow down requests by **Security Threat Level** (Low, Medium, High).

    />

3. Click on any request to open its detailed view on the right side of the dashboard. Go to the **Security** tab.

    />

4. This security audit graph shows the percentage of passed and failed checks and the total number of requests categorized by threat level (Low, Medium, High).

    />

5. The overall security status of the API shows the 13 security checks with threat level.

    />

 6. When you click on any threat level, you will see details about it, helping you understand how to improve it.

## How Threat Levels Are Calculated

Treblle uses an ETL process to calculate the threat level:
- IP address analysis (proxy, crawler, TOR detection) using services like [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/).
- Internal security checks, such as:
  - Missing SSL (Medium Threat Level).
  - Detected SQL Injection patterns (High Threat Level).

Each request undergoes these checks to ensure accurate threat level assignment.


### Low Threat Level

Detected issues include:

- **IDs vs UUIDs:** Check if endpoints use UUIDs instead of sequential IDs for improved security.

- **Rate Limiting:** Verifies the presence of `x-ratelimit-*` headers to prevent abusive behavior.

- **Content Labeling:** Ensures the `Content-Type` header uses `application/json.`

- **MIME Sniffing Protection:** Confirms the `X-Content-Type-Options` header is set to `nosniff`.

- **Force Secure Connection:** Looks for the `strict-transport-security` header to enforce HTTPS.

- **Embedding Prevention:** Validates the `X-Frame-Options` header to mitigate clickjacking attacks.

- **Security Policies:** Checks for a `Content-Security-Policy` header. CSP helps prevent various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

- **Content-Type Specification:** Confirms that the `Accept` header specifies `application/json.`

- **Method Limiting:** Verifies the presence of the `Allow` header to specify allowed HTTP methods.


### Medium Threat Level

Detected issues include:

- **Authorization:** Ensures proper usage and configuration of authorization mechanisms.

### High Threat Level

Detected issues include:

- **SQL Injection:** Analyzes payloads for common SQL injection patterns.

- **IP Reputation:** Evaluate the reputation of the request's IP address for potential malicious activity.

- **Secure Connection:**  Confirms that requests use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

Treblle helps you monitor and secure your API traffic in real time, ensuring a safer API ecosystem.
