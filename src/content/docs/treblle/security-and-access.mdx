Protect your Treblle account with robust security features including multi-factor authentication, secure password management, and access controls. These security measures help safeguard your API data and account information.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enhance your account security with multi-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of protection beyond your password.

### Setting Up MFA

1. **Navigate to Security Settings**
   
   Access the Multi-Factor Authentication section in your account settings.

2. **Scan QR Code**
   
   Use an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) to scan the provided QR code.

3. **Enter Verification Code**
   
   Input the 6-digit code from your authenticator app to verify the setup.

4. **Complete Setup**
   
   Click **Verify MFA** to enable multi-factor authentication on your account.

### Using MFA

Once enabled, you'll need to provide a one-time secret from your authenticator app every time you log in, significantly improving your account security.

### Managing MFA

- **Disable MFA**: Use the **Disable MFA** button if you need to turn off multi-factor authentication
- **Re-enable MFA**: Follow the setup process again to re-activate MFA
