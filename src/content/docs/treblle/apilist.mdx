All APIs that you add to treblle in your workspace are displayed here. This view is the fastest way to catch up with the status of all your APIs. While the homepage is focused on giving you a high-level snapshot of all major metrics across the workspace, the API list view lets you dive into each API individually. Here you can see a detailed list of all your APIs, monitor their performance, and quickly search for the one you need.

This page is designed to be a one step lookup for all your APIs before you decide to investigate a specific API.

## Actions You Can Take From This Page

Hereâ€™s what you can do while you're scrolling through APIs using the API List:

- **Switch between workspaces easily**: Use the top-left corner dropdown to move between different workspaces without losing context.
- **Create a new API**: Add a new API to your workspace using the **New API** button on the left navigation bar or beside the time range buttons.
- **Use the time filter**: Toggle between the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, all time, or a custom range to analyze API trends over the timeframe you care about.
- **Sort, filter, and favorite APIs**: Quickly organize your API list to focus on what matters most for your team by using sorting, filtering, and favoriting options.
- **Access workspace-level functionality**: Navigate to **API Tracing, API Catalog, or Settings** (if you are a Treblle admin) directly from the left navigation bar for workspace management.

## Individual API section

Each API in your workspace is displayed as a **dedicated, clear section** showing essential details at a glance, making it easy to scan and prioritize across all your APIs.
