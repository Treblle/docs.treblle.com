### How IP Reputation Checking Works

IP Reputation check **evaluates the trustworthiness and reputation of an IP address** based on its historical behavior and associations. It helps identify potential threats, such as spam or malicious activity, by assessing the IP's track record and reputation within the online community.

Treblle uses **its own network alongside 3rd party services** to check the reputation of your user's IP addresses, providing comprehensive threat intelligence for every request.
