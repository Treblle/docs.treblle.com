Treblle provides a comprehensive notification system that delivers intelligent alerts and real-time updates across multiple channels, designed to keep users informed without overwhelming them.

## Managing Default Alerts

While default alerts are automatically enabled with smart settings, you have control over your notification preferences:

### Alert Frequency

- **Immediate**: Real-time notifications for critical issues
- **Batched**: Grouped notifications to reduce notification fatigue
- **Digest format**: Summary reports at scheduled intervals

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate attention required (service outages, security issues)
- **High**: Important but not urgent (error rate spikes, performance issues)
- **Medium**: Informational updates (new features, team changes)
- **Low**: General notifications (usage reports, maintenance schedules)

### Customization Options

While these are default system alerts, you can:

- Adjust notification timing and frequency
- Choose preferred communication channels
- Set up additional custom alerts for specific scenarios
- Create team-specific notification rules
