[Aspen](https://treblle.com/product/aspen) is a Treblle's free, native macOS application designed specifically for testing REST APIs. Built with privacy in mind, it requires no login and stores no data, ensuring a smooth, local testing experience.

Aspen comes with an integrated [AI assistant](https://treblle.com/product/alfred) to help automate API integration tasks, such as generating data models, Open API Specifications (OAS), and integration code.

  />

- **View Response**:  
   Aspen displays the response from the API directly in the interface, showing the status code and returned data.

## Aspen Collections

- Aspen's Collections feature allows you to organize your API requests into groups for easy management and reuse.

- You can create folders and sub-folders within Collections to organize your requests by API flow, service, or any other criteria.

#### Create a Collection:

- From the History sidebar, save your API requests as a Collection and name them according to your needs.

#### Search Through Collections:

- You can search through your saved Collections to quickly find specific requests. This is especially helpful when managing a large number of requests.
