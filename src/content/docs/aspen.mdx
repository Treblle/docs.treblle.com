### What is Aspen?

[Aspen](https://treblle.com/product/aspen) is Treblleâ€™s free, native macOS application explicitly designed to test REST APIs. Built with privacy in mind, it requires no login and stores no data, ensuring a smooth, local testing experience.

Aspen has an integrated [AI assistant](https://treblle.com/product/alfred-ai) to help automate API integration tasks, such as generating data models, Open API Specifications (OAS), and integration code.

## Aspen Collections

   - Aspen's Collections feature allows you to organize your API requests into groups for easy management and reuse.

   - You can create folders and sub-folders within Collections to organize your requests by API flow, service, or other criteria.

     #### Create a Collection

      From the History sidebar, save your API requests as a Collection and name them according to your needs.

        width="800"
        style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
      />

     #### Search Through Collections

      You can search through your saved Collections to quickly find specific requests.
