<Card title="How do I map my API credentials in Treblle?">

Set your credentials using environment variables:

```bash
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Where to find these values:**
- Go to your Treblle 3.0 workspace
- Navigate to API Settings
- Copy your Project ID and API Key

</Card>

<Card title="My API requests aren't showing up. What should I check?">

**First, verify you're using the correct platform:**
- ✅ Use [platform.treblle.com](https://platform.treblle.com/) 
- ❌ Don't use the legacy [app.treblle.com](https://app.treblle.com/)

**Common troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check your credentials** - Ensure `TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID` and `TREBLLE_API_KEY` match your workspace
2. **Network settings** - Allow HTTPS requests to `*.treblle.com` domains
3. **Request limits** - Verify you haven't exceeded your plan's monthly limit
4. **SDK integration** - Confirm the Treblle SDK is properly installed and configured

**Still not working?** Contact support at [treblle.com](https://treblle.com/) → Resources → Support

<Card title="Can I test Treblle with localhost?">

**Yes!** Treblle works with localhost if:

- ✅ SDK is properly initialized
- ✅ Your machine has internet access  
- ✅ No proxy blocks traffic to Treblle endpoints

**Quick test:** Make a request to your local API and check your Treblle dashboard within a few seconds.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

<Card title="How does Treblle protect my data?">

**Treblle prioritizes security with multiple layers of protection:**

**🔐 Automatic Data Masking**
- Passwords, API keys, and sensitive fields are automatically masked
- Data is masked **before leaving your server**
- You control which additional fields to mask

**🛡️ Encryption & Compliance**
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- ISO 27001, GDPR, SOC 2, CCPA, and PCI DSS compliant
- Regular security audits and assessments

**🎯 What you can control:**
- Exclude specific endpoints from logging
- Configure custom field masking
- Set up compliance scanning

</Card>

<Card title="How do I mask sensitive data in URLs?">

**Important:** Treblle only masks request/response bodies and headers - **not URL paths**.

**If your URLs contain sensitive data, you have two options:**

**Option 1: Exclude the endpoint**
```javascript
// Example: Skip Treblle for sensitive endpoints
if (req.path.includes('/sensitive-endpoint')) {
  return next(); // Skip Treblle middleware
}
```

**Option 2: Redesign the URL structure**
```bash
# Instead of:
/api/users/secret-key-123/profile

# Use:
/api/users/profile?token=secret-key-123
# (token will be masked in query parameters)
```

</Card>

<Card title="Do I need to change DNS settings for Treblle?">

**No DNS changes required!** 

Treblle integrates directly into your API backend via our SDK. You keep using your custom domain exactly as before.

**How it works:**
- Your API runs on your domain (e.g., `api.yourcompany.com`)
- Treblle SDK captures request/response data
- Data is sent to Treblle's servers for analysis
- Your API continues working normally

</Card>

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<Card title="I upgraded my SDK but still have issues with keys">

**Common issue with Treblle 3.0 upgrades:**

**✅ Use environment variables (recommended):**
```bash
# In your .env file
TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

**❌ Remove hardcoded credentials:**
```javascript
// Remove this old configuration
treblle({
  apiKey: "hardcoded_key",
  projectId: "hardcoded_id"
})

// SDK will automatically use environment variables
treblle()
```

**🔍 Debugging steps:**
1. Check your `.env` file has correct values
2. Restart your application after changes
3. Verify you're using the latest SDK version
4. Check for typos in environment variable names

</Card>

<Card title="Getting SSL connection timeout errors?">

**SSL timeout errors usually indicate network issues:**

**🌐 Network Troubleshooting:**
- Check if your deployment environment can reach external services
- Verify no firewall rules block outbound HTTPS requests
- Test connection to `treblle.com` from your server

**🔧 Code Solutions:**
```javascript
// Add retry logic for network issues
const treblle = require('treblle');

// Configure with timeout settings
treblle({
  timeout: 10000, // 10 second timeout
  retries: 3      // Retry failed requests
});
```

**📊 Monitoring:**
- Add detailed logging around SDK initialization
- Monitor SSL handshake timing
- Check server resource usage during requests
