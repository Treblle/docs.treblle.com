## Role and Permissions

Treblle provides two layers of roles and permissions:

- Workspace Level: Manage who can enter your workspace and what they can generally do.
- API Level: Grant access to specific APIs (separate from workspace access) and control what users can do on those APIs.

This ensures security, accountability, and efficient collaboration across your API landscape.

## Workspace-Level Roles and Permissions

![people.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/people.png)

### Key Actions (Workspace → Settings → People)

Workspace Owners can:

- Invite users via email or an invite link. When generating a link, you can preselect the role (Owner/Member/Customer) and optionally assign a Group before sharing. Invitees must create/sign in to a Treblle account for the link to work.
- Assign roles during or after inviting.
- View and manage users, including their emails and roles.
- Change user roles as team needs evolve.
- **Delete users** to remove workspace access.

> Note: The invite link role/group preset happens before you generate the link.


### Groups (Workspace → Settings → Groups)

![groups.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/groups.png)

Use Groups to grant API access in bulk:

- Create groups (e.g., “Finance”, “Health”, “Vendors”), add members, then grant the group access to one or more APIs. Everyone in the group inherits that API access.
- Revoking an individual’s API access does not remove access they still receive via a group. Remove them from the group or remove the group’s API access to fully revoke.

---

## How Workspace and API Access Work Together

- Inviting someone to the workspace does not automatically grant them access to any API. API access is a separate step.
- You cannot invite directly to an API if the person isn’t in the workspace. First add them to the workspace, then grant API access (individually or via a Group).
- API access can be managed centrally from Workspace → API Access (global view).

## Workspace Roles

![roles.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/roles.png)

| Role | Can Add/Delete Users | Can Change Permissions | API Creation | Access to APIs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Owner | Yes | Yes | Production & Non-Prod | All APIs (once granted) | Admin of workspace; billing, settings, user control. |
| Member | Can invite, cannot delete | No | Non-Production only | Read-only by default; can filter and explore | Buttons for write/update actions are hidden; primarily **view** permissions. 
 |
| Customer | No | No | No | Catalog-only by default | Intended for external users; default is “catalog only.” 
 |

> Custom roles: You can create custom roles by mixing specific permissions (e.g., some “owner-level” capabilities with a subset of “member” ones). Editing/bespoke roles may depend on your plan; on some free workspaces, role editing is restricted.

## API-Level Roles and Permissions

### Key Actions 

From Workspace → API Access (or API settings, where available), you can:

![api-access.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/api-access.png)

- Grant API access to individuals or Groups.
- Change API-level roles (e.g., make someone a read-only member).
- Remove users from an API while retaining their workspace access.
- Make the API private (invite-only) and delete the API (owner-level). *(Capabilities may vary by plan/UI location.)*

### Default API Roles

| Role | View Dashboards & Traces | Modify API Settings | Make API Private | Delete API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Owner | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Member | Yes (read, incl. filters) | No | No | No |
- Member: read-only; can filter and explore, but update/action buttons are hidden.

---

## Common Scenarios

### Invite with preset role & group

Generate a link in Settings → People, choose the default Role and optional Group, then share. Recipient signs in/creates an account, joins workspace with those presets. API access still needs granting (unless covered via the Group). 

![invite-with-link.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/invite-with-link.png)

### Grant API access to a whole team

Create a Group → add users → in API Access, grant the Group access. Everyone in the group immediately sees the API (read/write depending on role). 

![edit-api-access.png](/platform/manage-your-workspace/edit-api-access.png)

### Revoke API access cleanly

If a user still sees an API after you removed their **individual** access, check if they inherit access **via a Group**. Remove them from the group or remove the group from API Access.
