Workspace settings allow you to configure and customize your Treblle workspace according to your team's needs. 

As a workspace owner, you can manage workspace details, security settings, sharing options, and administrative controls.

## Workspace Details

Configure the basic information and branding for your workspace to help team members identify and understand its purpose.

#### Leaving Process

2. **Transfer Ownership**: If you're the owner, transfer to another member first
3. **Click Leave**: Use the **Leave** button in workspace options
4. **Confirm Action**: Acknowledge the consequences of leaving

#### Consequences of Leaving
